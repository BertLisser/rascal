Synopsis:

Description:

An assert statement may occur everywhere where a declaration is allowed. It has two forms:

An assert statement consists of a Boolean expression $Exp_1$ and an optional string expression $Exp_2$
that serves as a identifying message for this assertion. 

When $Exp_1$ evaluates to `false`, an `AssertionFailed` exception is thrown.

Examples:
<screen>
assert 1==2 : "is never true";
int div(int x, int y) {
  assert y != 0 : "y must be non-zero";
  return x / y;
}
div(4,0);
</screen>
