This means that values are immutable and are always freshly constructed from existing parts and that sharing and aliasing problems are completely avoided. The language also provides variables. A value can be associated with a variable as the result of an explicit assignment statement: during the lifetime of a variable different (immutable) values may be assignment to it. Other ways to associate a value with a variable is by way of function calls (binding of formal parameters to actual values) and as the result of a successful pattern match.\n","","","",[])
