The purpose of the visitor design pattern is to decouple the logistics of visiting each node from the actual operation on each node. In Rascal the logistics of visiting is completely automated.\n \<br/\>\n\<br/\>\n\n Visiting is achieved by way of visit expressions that resemble the switch statement. A visit expressions traverses an arbitrarily complex subject value and applies a number of cases to all its subtrees. \n All the elements of the subject are visited and when one of the cases matches the statements associated \n with that case are executed. These cases may:\n  \<ul\>\<li\> cause some side effect, i.e., assign a value to local or global variables;\</li\>\n\<li\> execute an \<a href=\"/show?concept=Insert\"\>Insert\</a\> statement that replaces the current element;\</li\>\n\<li\> execute a \<a href=\"/show?concept=Fail\"\>Fail\</a\> statement that causes the match for the current case to fail (and undoing all side-effects due to the successful match itself and the execution of the statements so far).\</li\>\n\</ul\> The value of a visit expression is the original subject value with all replacements made as dictated by matching cases. The traversal order in a visit expressions can be explicitly defined by the programmer. \n"," An example of visiting is given in \<a href=\"/show?concept=ColoredTrees\"\>ColoredTrees\</a\>.\n","","",[])
