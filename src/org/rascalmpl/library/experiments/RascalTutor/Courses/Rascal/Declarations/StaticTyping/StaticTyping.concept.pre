The type \<code\>void\</code\> is the \<i\>smallest\</i\> type and \n is included in all other types and the type \<code\>value\</code\> is the \<i\>largest\</i\> type that includes all other types. \n We also see that \<code\>rel\</code\> is a subtype of \<code\>set\</code\> and that each ADT is a subtype of \<code\>node\</code\>. \n A special role is played by the datatype \<tt\>Tree\</tt\> that is the generic type of syntax trees. \n Syntax trees for specific languages are all subtypes of \<code\>Tree\</code\>. As a result, syntax trees can be addressed at two levels: \n \<ul\>\<li\> in a generic fashion as \<code\>Tree\</code\> and,\</li\>\n\<li\> in a specific fashion as a more precisely typed syntax tree.  Finally, each \<code\>alias\</code\> is structurally equivalent to one or more specific other types.\n\</li\>\n\</ul\> The fact that the types are ordered in a lattice makes it possible to define a \<b\>Least Upper Bound\</b\> (lub) on types.\n Given two types \<code\>\<i\>T\</i\>\<sub\>1\</sub\>\</code\> and \<code\>\<i\>T\</i\>\<sub\>2\</sub\>\</code\>, \<code\>lub(\<i\>T\</i\>\<sub\>1\</sub\>, \<i\>T\</i\>\<sub\>2\</sub\>)\</code\> is defined as the nearest common super type of \<code\>\<i\>T\</i\>\<sub\>1\</sub\>\</code\> and \<code\>\<i\>T\</i\>\<sub\>2\</sub\>\</code\>\n in the type lattice.\n  \<h2\>Advanced Features\</h2\>\n The Rascal type system has various advanced features that are described separately:\n \<ul\>\<li\> Types may be be \<i\>parameterized\</i\> resulting in very general and reusable types, see \<a href=\"/show?concept=TypeParameters\"\>TypeParameters\</a\>.\</li\>\n\<li\> Declarations of \<a href=\"/show?concept=Function\"\>Function\</a\>s and \<a href=\"/show?concept=AlgebraicDataType\"\>AlgebraicDataType\</a\>s may be parameterized and \<a href=\"/show?concept=TypeConstraints\"\>TypeConstraints\</a\> can be used to define    constraints on the acual type to be used.\n\</li\>\n\<li\> The formal arguments of functions are bound to \<i\>values\</i\> but in exceptional cases   a function may need a type as argument value, \<a href=\"/show?concept=ReifiedTypes\"\>ReifiedTypes\</a\> make this possible.\n\</li\>\n\</ul\>","","","",[])
