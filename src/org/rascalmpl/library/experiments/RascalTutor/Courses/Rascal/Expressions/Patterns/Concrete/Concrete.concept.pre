concept("Concrete",|cwd:///src/org/rascalmpl/library/experiments/RascalTutor/Courses/Rascal/Expressions/Patterns/Concrete/Concrete.concept|,[],[],{},{},"","","","",{}," Suppose we want to manipulate text written in some hypothetical language LANG. \n Then first the concrete syntax of LANG has to be defined by importing an SDF module that declares the non-terminals and syntax rules for LANG. \n Next LANG programs have to be parsed. LANG programs made come from text files or they may be included in the Rascal program as literals. \n In both cases the text is parsed according to the defined syntax and the result is a parse tree in the form of a value of type Tree. \n Concrete patterns operate on these trees.\n \<br/\>\n\<br/\>\n\n A \<i\>concrete pattern\</i\> is a quoted concrete syntax fragment that may contain variables. The syntax that is used to parse the concrete pattern may come from any SDF module that has been imported in the module in which the concrete pattern occurs.\n \<br/\>\n\<br/\>\n\n A concrete pattern may have the following forms:\n  \<ul\>\<li\> \<i\>Quoted pattern\</i\> \<pre class=\"listing\"\>` \<i\>Token\</i\>\<sub\>1\</sub\> \<i\>Token\</i\>\<sub\>2\</sub\> ... \<i\>Token\</i\>\<sub\>n\</sub\> `\n\</pre\> Inside a quoted pattern arbitrary lexical tokens may occur.
