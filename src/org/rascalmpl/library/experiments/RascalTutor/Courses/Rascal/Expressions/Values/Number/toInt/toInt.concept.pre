This conversion is analogous to a narrowing primitive conversion from double to long as defined in the Java Language Specification: any fractional part of this BigDecimal will be discarded. Note that this conversion can loose information about the precision of the BigDecimal value.\n"," \<pre class=\"screen\"\>\<b\>rascal\>\</b\>import Number;\nok\n\<b\>rascal\>\</b\>toInt(13)\nint: 13\n\<b\>rascal\>\</b\>toInt(13.5)\nint: 13\n\</pre\>","","",[])
