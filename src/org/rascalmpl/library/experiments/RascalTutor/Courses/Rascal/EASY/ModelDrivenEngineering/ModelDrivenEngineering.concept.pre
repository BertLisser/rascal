She and her team have designed a UML model of the control software and have extended it with annotations that describe the reliability of individual components. She will use this annotated model in two ways: \n \<ul\>\<li\> to extract relevant information from it to synthesize input for a statistical tool that will compute overall system reliability from the reliability of individual components;\</li\>\n\<li\> to generate executable code that takes the reliability issues into account.\</li\>\n\</ul\>","","","",[])
