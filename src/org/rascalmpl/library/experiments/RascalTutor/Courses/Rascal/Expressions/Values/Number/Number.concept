Types:
`int`, `real`, `num`

Description:
Numbers include integers (values of type `int`) and reals (values of type `real`). 
If both operands have the same type (`int` or `real`) then the operator is the corresponding operator on integers or reals. Otherwise, integer arguments are first converted to real and the real operator is applied.
