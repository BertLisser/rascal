Synopsis:

Description:

`Tree` is the universal parse tree data type and can be used to parse text in any language. 
We do not give its full declaration here since internal details are never needed by Rascal users. 
The following is noteworthy:

* `Tree` is a subtype of the type [Node].

* All parse trees for a specific language are a subtype of `Tree`.

* Trees can be annotated in various ways:
  ** Source code location:
<listing>
anno loc Tree@\loc;
</listing>

  ** An (error) message (see [Message]) related to a certain sub-tree:
<listing>
anno Message Tree@message;
</listing>

  ** All (error) messages relevant for a certain sub-tree:
<listing>
anno set[Message] Tree@messages;
</listing>

  ** A documentation string for this parse tree node:
<listing>
anno str Tree@doc;
</listing>

  ** The target of a link associated with a parse tree node:
<listing>
anno loc Tree@link;
</listing>

Pittfalls:
For historical reasons the name of the annotation is "loc" and this interferes with the Rascal keyword `loc`
for the type of [Location]s.
Therefore the annotation name has to be escaped as `\loc` when it is declared or used.
