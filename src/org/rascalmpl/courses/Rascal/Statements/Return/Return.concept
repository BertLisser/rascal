Description:
A return statement comes in two variants: without and with an expression,
both variants end the execution of the current function. 
The first variant applies to functions with `void` as return type. 
The second variants applies to non-void functions and returns the value of $Exp$ as result of the function invocation.
The following rules apply:

* The static type of $Exp$ should be compatible with the declared return type of the function in 
  which the return statement occurs.

* In each function with a return type that is not void, every possible execution path through the body of 
  the function should end in a return statement.


In each function with a return type that is void, a return statement is implicitly assumed at the end of each execution path through the function body.

Examples:
<screen>
int twice(int n) { return 2 * n; }
twice(5);
// Functions that only return a value can be abbreviated (and the return is implicit):
int twiceb(int n) = 2 * n;
twiceb(5);
