Description:
A tuple is a sequence of elements with the following properties:

* Each element in a tuple (may) have a different type.

* Each element of a tuple may have a label that can be used to select that element of the tuple.

* Each tuple is fixed-width, i.e., has the same number of elements.


Tuples are represented by the type `tuple[$T_1$ $L_1$, $T_2$ $L_2$, ...]`, 
where $T_1$, $T_2$, ... are arbitrary types and $L_1$, $L_2$, ... are optional labels. 

The following functions are provided for tuples:
