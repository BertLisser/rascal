Questions:

QChoice: A map maps keys to values. In a map:
g: All keys have to be unique.
g: All keys have the same type.
g: All keys should have the same type and all values should have the same type. The type of keys and values may be different.
b: All keys should have the same type and all values should have the same type. The type of keys and values should be the same.
b: All values have to be unique.
b: All keys and values have to be unique.
b: All keys are sorted.

QChoice: In a tuple:
g: All elements may have different types.
b: All elements should have the same type.
b: The number of elements is not fixed.
g: The number of elements is fixed.
g: The order of the elements is relevant.
b: The order of the elements is not relevant.

QChoice: A relation:
g: Is a set of tuples.
b: Is a list of tuples.
b: Is a tuple of tuples.
b: Has ordered elements.
g: Has unordered elements.
g: Can not contain duplicates.
b: Can contain duplicates.
b: Has a fixed length.


QChoice: The type of a set is determined by:
g: The least upperbound of the type of all elements.
g: The types of all the elements in the set.
b: The type of the element that was first added to the set.
b: The average of the type of the elements with the smallest and the largests type.
b: The least upperbound of the type of two arbitrary elements.
b: The type of two arbitrary elements.

QChoice: Which statement about the domain and range function on a binary relation of type `rel[int,int]` is correct:
g: Domain returns a set of the first element of each tuple in the relation and range returns a set of the second element of each tuple.
g: Domain and range are only applicable to binary relations.
b: Domain returns a list of the first element of each tuple in the relation and range returns a list of the second element of each tuple.
b: Domain returns a set of the second element of each tuple in the relation and range returns a set of the first element of each tuple.
b: Domain returns a list of the second element of each tuple in the relation and range returns a list of the first element of each tuple.
b: Domain returns a set of the elements that occur in any tuple in the relation and range returns a list of those elements.

QValue:
desc: Create a list of the right size.
list:
import List;
list[str] text = <?>;
test: size(text) == 3;

QValue:
desc: Return the strings that contain a given substring.
list:
text = ["An", "honest", "man", "is", "always", "a", "child"]; 
public list[str] find(list[str] text, str contains) = [ s | s <- text, <?> ];
test: find(text, "n") == ["An", "honest", "man"];

QValue:
desc: Return the set of largest words.
list:
import Number;
import String;
text = ["Quote", "from", "Steve", "Jobs", ":", "And", "one", "more", "thing"];
public list[str] largest(list[str] text){
  mx = ( 0 | max(it, size(s)) | s <- text );
  return
    for(s <- text)
        if(<?>)
           append s;
}
test: largest(text) == ["Quote", "Steve", "thing"];

QValue:
desc: Complete this function that returns the set of keys with the smallest associated value.
list:
import Map;
import Set;
inventory = ("orange" : 20, "apple" : 15, "banana" : 25, "lemon" : 15);
public set[str] lowest(map[str,int] inv){
    m = <?>; // Determine the minimal value in the map
    return { s  | s <- inv, inv[s] == m };
}
test: lowest(inventory) == {"apple", "lemon"};


QValue:
desc: Complete this function that tests that a list of words consists of two identical sublists:
list:
import List;
public bool isReplicated(list[str] words){
  return [list[str] L, <?>] := words;
}
test: isReplicated(["a", "b", "a", "b"]) == true;


QValue:
desc: Given a data type `ColoredTree`, complete the definition of the function `flipRedChildren` that exchanges the children of all red nodes.
list:
data ColoredTree = leaf(int N)      
                 | red(ColoredTree left, ColoredTree right) 
                 | black(ColoredTree left, ColoredTree right);

ColoredTree rb = red(black(leaf(1), red(leaf(2),leaf(3))), black(leaf(3), leaf(4)));

public ColoredTree flipRedChildren(ColoredTree t){
  return visit(t){
     case red(l,r) => <?>
  };
}
test: flipRedChildren(rb) == red( black(leaf(3), leaf(4)), black(leaf(1), red(leaf(3),leaf(2))));
