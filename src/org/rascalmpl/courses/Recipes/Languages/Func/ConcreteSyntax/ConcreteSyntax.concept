The concrete syntax of Func uses many features of Rascal's syntax definitions. Some notes:
*  The definition of lexical syntax follows the pattern:
   ** Define lexical symbols (`Ident`, `Natural`).
   ** Define rules for layout.
   ** Use follow restrictions (`!>>`) to enforce the longest match of lexical symbols.
* The definition of lexical also follows a common pattern:
  ** List of non-terminal is defined with their alternatives.
  ** One non-terminal is designated as start symbol (`Prog`).
  ** Each alternative has a label, this is for the benefit of converting parse trees to abstract syntaxt trees.
  ** Each alternative spells out its priority and associativity.
